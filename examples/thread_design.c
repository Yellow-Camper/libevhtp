/*
 * How to exploit the wonders of libevhtp's threading model to avoid using
 * libevent's locking API.
 *
 * In this example we use Redis's Async API (Libhiredis) store and retry the following
 * information for a request:
 *
 * Total requests seen.
 * Total requests seen by the requestors IP address.
 * All of the source ports seen used by the requestors IP address.
 *
 * We do this all using libevhtp's builtin thread-pool model, without the use of
 * mutexes or evthread_use_pthreads() type stuff.
 *
 * The technique is simple:
 *  1. Create your evhtp_t structure, assign callbacks like usual.
 *  2. Call evhtp_use_threads() with a thread init callback.
 *  3. Each time a thread starts, the thread init callback you defined will be
 *     called with information about that thread.
 *
 *     First a bit of information about how evhtp does threading:
 *       libevhtp uses the evthr library, which works more like a threaded
 *       co-routine than a threadpool. Each evthr in a pool has its own unique
 *       event_base (and each evthr runs its own event_base_loop()). Under the
 *       hood when libevhtp sends a request to a thread, it calls
 *       "evthr_pool_defer(pool, _run_connection_in_thread, ...).
 *
 *       The evthr library then finds a thread inside the pool with the lowest backlog,
 *       sends a packet over that threads socketpair containing information about what
 *       function to execute. It uses socketpairs because they can be treated as
 *       an event, thus able to be processed in a threads own unique
 *       event_base_loop().
 *
 *       Knowing that, a connection in evhtp is never associated with the initial
 *       event_base that was passed to evhtp_new(), but instead the connection
 *       uses the evthr's unique event_base. This is what makes libevhtp's
 *       safe from thread-related race conditions.
 *
 *  4. Use the thread init callback as a place to put event type things on the
 *     threads event_base() instead of using the global one.
 *
 *     In this code, that function is app_init_thread(). When this function is
 *     called, the first argument is the evthr_t of the thread that just
 *     started. This function uses "evthr_get_base(thread)" to get the
 *     event_base associated with this specific thread.
 *
 *     Using that event_base, the function will start up an async redis
 *     connection. This redis connection is now tied to that thread, and can be
 *     used on a threaded request without locking (remember that your request
 *     has the same event_base as the thread it was executed in).
 *
 *     We allocate a dummy structure "struct app" and then call
 *     "evthr_set_aux(thread, app)". This function sets some aux data which can
 *     be fetched at any point using evthr_get_aux(thread). We use this later on
 *     inside process_request()
 *
 *     This part is the secret to evhtp threading success.
 *
 *  5. When a request has been fully processed, it will call the function
 *     "app_process_request()". Note here that the "arg" argument is NULL since no
 *      arguments were passed to evhtp_set_gencb().
 *
 *     Since we want to do a bunch of redis stuff before sending a reply to the
 *     client, we must fetch the "struct app" data we allocated and set for the
 *     thread associated with this request (struct app * app =
 *     evthr_get_aux(thread);).
 *
 *     struct app has our thread-specific redis connection ctx, so using that
 *     redisAsyncCommand() is called a bunch of times to queue up the commands
 *     which will be run.
 *
 *     The last part of this technique is to call the function
 *     "evhtp_request_pause()". This essentially tells evhtp to flip the
 *     read-side of the connections file-descriptor OFF (This avoids potential
 *     situations where a client disconnected before all of the redis commands
 *     executed).
 *
 *  6. Each redis command is executed in order, and each callback will write to
 *     the requests output_buffer with relevant information from the result.
 *
 *  7. The last redis callback executed here is "redis_get_srcport_cb". It is
 *      the job os this function to call evhtp_send_reply() and then
 *      evhtp_request_resume().
 *
 * Using this design in conjunction with libevhtp makes the world an easier
 * place to code.
 *
 * Compile: gcc thread_design.c -o thread_design -levhtp -levent -lhiredis
