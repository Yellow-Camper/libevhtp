## Performance stuff

While we never documented any benchmark publically,
the popular open source project [ZIMG](http://zimg.buaa.us) did a bit of that
for us.The ZIMG team decided to move away from NGINX to libevhtp for their
software, and the results were pretty outstanding. Here is a graph showing their
application under very high load

![ZIMG GRAPH](/zimg_vs_nginx.png)

The X-axis is the number of connections, while the Y-axis is requests per
second.

Slightly outdated (Now faster!)
